# websentiment
I created a website that users can enter keywords in as queries. The web app would then scrape the internet find releavant articles within the last week relating to said query. Identify ones that would be relevant to someones investment decisions. Provide a sentiment for each article, and if applicable, score sentiment for the keyword. Finally web app would summarize the found, relevant, articles and provide the user with an easily digestable charge and xl output file. 

#MODELS
Models where trained in Jupyter Notebook, models where based on BERT. Training data was manually labelled by me, both for the initial classification portion and the secondary sentiment scoring portion.
Due to size limitations I did not upload the models to GitHUB if you are interested in those please reach out and I can arrange sending them over to you.app would then scrape the internet find releavant articles within the last week
